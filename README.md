# GEOM2159_Module_5_Processing_Tool
###### Final submission for Module 5 ######
This tool creates random training sample data from an input raster. The number of samples and distance between samples can be specified by the user. The output is in polygon format, for compatibility with ArcGIS machine learning classifiers. Input raster should be single band and classified. The output will be named as specified in file, but appear as "Buffered" if output file after running algorithm is selected.

For testing, I recommend using the default values for the number of points and for the distance between points. Test_Raster.tif should be used as the input raster (although you can try another if you would like!).
