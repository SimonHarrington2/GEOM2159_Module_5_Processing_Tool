# GEOM2159_Module_5_Processing_Tool
##### Final submission for Module 5 #####
This tool creates random training sample data from an input raster. The number of samples and distance between samples can be specified by the user. The output is in polygon format, for compatibility with ArcGIS machine learning classifiers. Input raster should be single band and classified. The output will be named as specified in file, but appear as "Buffered" if output file after running algorithm is selected.
